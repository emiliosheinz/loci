# Loci

A simple, frictionless app to capture anything in the moment.

## Quick Start

The entire development workflow should happen within Docker containers to ensure consistency across environments. 

```bash
# Start development environment
docker compose up -d
```

If you want to run any CLI commands make sure to do so within the `workspace` container:

```bash
# Open a shell in the workspace container
docker compose exec workspace sh 

# Or run a command directly
docker compose exec workspace <command>
```

### Using the loci helper

For convenience, the repo already includes a helper script at bin/loci. It runs commands inside the workspace container so you donâ€™t have to type docker exec every time:

```bash
bin/loci pnpm install
bin/loci pnpm nx test api
bin/loci pnpm nx run-many -t check 
```

> ðŸš¨ Even though you can run commands on your host machine, it's highly recommended to always use the Docker container to avoid environment discrepancies.

## Project structure

The project is organized as a monorepo using npm workspaces Nx and Docker to manage multiple applications and shared packages.

### Apps

- `api`: The backend API built with Node.js and Nest.

### Packages

- `config`: Shared configuration files.
