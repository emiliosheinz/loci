# Contributing to Loci

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Loci! üéâ We're excited to have you join our community and help make Loci an amazing tool for capturing and organizing ideas.

This guide will help you get started with contributing, whether you're fixing a bug, adding a feature, or improving documentation.

## Getting Started

### Development Setup

Loci uses a Docker-based development environment to ensure consistency across all contributors. Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/emiliosheinz/loci.git
   cd loci
   ```

2. **Start the development environment**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

3. **Use the loci helper script**
   
   For convenience, we provide a helper script that runs commands inside the workspace container:
   ```bash
   bin/loci pnpm install
   bin/loci pnpm nx test api
   bin/loci pnpm nx run-many -t check
   ```

   > üí° **Tip**: Even though you can run commands on your host machine, we highly recommend always using the Docker container to avoid environment discrepancies.

### Learn About Loci

Before contributing, take some time to understand the project:

- **Product Vision**: Visit our [product vision, features and strategy page](https://github.com/emiliosheinz/loci/wiki/Product-vision,-features,-and-strategy) to understand Loci's goals and direction
- **Architecture**: Review the [Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)](./docs/architecture/decisions/) to understand key technical decisions
- **Project Structure**: Check the [README](./README.md) for an overview of the monorepo structure and quick start guide

## How to Contribute

### üêõ Reporting Issues

Found a bug or have a feature request? We'd love to hear from you!

1. **Search existing issues** first to avoid duplicates
2. **Use issue templates** when available to provide all necessary information
3. **Be descriptive** - include steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and actual behavior
4. **Add labels** to help categorize your issue

### üí° Proposing Changes

#### Small Changes
For small fixes and improvements:
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch from `main`
3. Make your changes
4. Submit a pull request

#### Large Changes
For significant features or architectural changes:
1. **Open an issue first** to discuss the proposed change
2. **Consider writing an ADR** if the change affects architecture or has long-term implications
3. **Get feedback** from maintainers before starting implementation
4. Follow the same process as small changes once approved

### üîß Development Workflow

#### Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/issue-description
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   bin/loci pnpm install
   ```

3. **Make your changes**
   - Write clean, readable code
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation if needed

4. **Run the checks locally**
   ```bash
   # Run linting
   bin/loci pnpm nx affected --target=lint
   
   # Run formatting
   bin/loci pnpm nx affected --target=format
   
   # Run tests
   bin/loci pnpm nx affected --target=test
   
   # Run builds
   bin/loci pnpm nx affected --target=build
   ```

#### Code Style

We use [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for linting and formatting to keep our codebase consistent:

- **Automatic formatting** - Biome will format your code automatically
- **Linting rules** - Follow the configured Biome rules
- **Configuration** - See our shared config in [`packages/config`](./packages/config/)

Run formatting and linting:
```bash
bin/loci pnpm nx format
bin/loci pnpm nx lint
```

#### Testing

- **Write tests** for new features and bug fixes
- **Run tests locally** before submitting your PR
- **Maintain test coverage** - aim to keep or improve existing coverage
- We use **Jest** as our test runner

#### Documentation

- **Update relevant documentation** when making changes
- **Add JSDoc comments** for new functions and classes
- **Update README** if your changes affect setup or usage
- **Consider ADRs** for architectural decisions

### üìù Commit Messages

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to maintain a clear and consistent commit history. All commits are automatically validated using commitlint.

#### Format
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

#### Types
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- `ci`: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
- `chore`: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- `revert`: Reverts a previous commit

#### Examples
```bash
feat(api): add user authentication endpoint
fix(api): resolve memory leak in request handling
docs: update contributing guidelines
test(api): add unit tests for user service
```

#### Rules
- Use lowercase for type and description
- Don't end the subject line with a period
- Keep the subject line under 72 characters
- Use the imperative mood ("add" not "adds" or "added")

### üîÑ Pull Request Process

1. **Create a pull request** from your feature branch to `main`
2. **Fill out the PR template** with all requested information
3. **Ensure all checks pass** - our CI will run:
   - Linting and formatting checks
   - All tests
   - Build verification
   - Docker build verification
   - Conventional commit validation
4. **Request review** from maintainers
5. **Address feedback** promptly and professionally
6. **Keep your branch up to date** with `main` if needed

#### PR Requirements
- [ ] All CI checks pass
- [ ] Code has been tested locally
- [ ] Documentation updated if necessary
- [ ] Conventional commit format used
- [ ] Linked to relevant issue (if applicable)
